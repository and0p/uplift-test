Jotting down thoughts as I work:

- I think you need to use triple backticks to indicate code in a github commit message, so `npx ts-jest config:init` is missing from 890dd45
- I'm thinking of just using the `index.ts` file here for all the logic. The kata specified core logic so I'm building as a module, so not using an express server or anything where I'm putting the logic in a service.
- I'm a fan of conventional commits but usually only when there are JIRA tickets or other tracking information to accompany them.
- I'm calling `exports.someFunction` in the `evaluateClaims` function to simplify mocking. In the context of a full application these could go into separate files, but for this exercise it seems sufficient.
